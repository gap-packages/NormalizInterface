This file describes changes in the NormalizInterface package.

1.4.1 (2025-06-20)
  - Janitorial changes

1.4.0 (2025-04-14)
  - Update to Normaliz 3.10.2 (as usual this implies many breaking
    changes, e.g. input type `lattice_ideal` has been renamed to
    `normal_toric_ideal` while at the same time `lattice_ideal` has
    a new meaning that is not quite compatible with how it worked before.
    So beware and carefully study the Normaliz manual)
  - Various janitorial changes

1.3.7 (2024-07-07)
  - Require C++14 (as Normaliz or rather e-Antic sometimes needs it, and
    it seems OK to require a C++ compiler made in the last 10 years
  - Require GAP >= 4.12.1 and use that to simplify some code and scripts
  - Improve the code which tries to automatically find GMP headers

1.3.6 (2023-05-19)
  - Improve compatibility with an upcoming GAP update
  - Minor janitorial changes

1.3.5 (2022-11-05)
  - Rename `build-normaliz.sh` to `prerequisites.sh` to match an
    undocumented convention used across several packages.
  - Minor build system tweaks

1.3.4 (2022-08-07)
  - Fix regression that broke building NormalizInterface on macOS

1.3.3 (2022-07-08)
  - Update to Normaliz 3.9.3
  - Improve build system to honor CPPFLAGS environment variable
  - Explicitly set a so-called "run path" / "rpath" when linking against the
    bundled copy of Normaliz (improves compatibility with future versions of
    the GAP compiler `gac`, which will not be using GNU libtool anymore)

1.3.2 (2022-02-24)
  - Fix building on Cygwin

1.3.1 (2022-02-19)
  - Fix building on FreeBSD

1.3.0 (2021-10-31)
  - Update to Normaliz 3.9.1
  - Improve the new build system
  - Various janitorial changes

1.2.0 (2020-03-26)
  - Update to Normaliz 3.8.4
  - New build system
  - Various janitorial changes

1.1.0 (2019-08-23)
  - Add support for rational inputs, e.g. polytopes with rational coordinates
  - Update build system for improve compatibility with GAP >= 4.9
  - Completely rewrote build-normaliz.sh (now downloads a tarball using
    curl or wget, instead of cloning a git repository)
  - Fix a potential crash when freeing proxy cone objects
  - Fix 'unknown cone property' that could occur when using newer versions of
    Normaliz, e.g. version 3.5.4
  - Display the Normaliz version as part of banner string
  - Loads of internal and janitorial changes
  - Require Normaliz 3.5.4 or newer (and add support for its new features)
  - Sebastian Gutsche is no longer package maintainer

1.0.2 (2017-12-04)
  - Use variable rays instead of Rays in test file

  - Detect C++11 capabilities of compiler, add c++11 flag if necessary

1.0.0 (2017-09-06)
  - update to libnormaliz 3.4.0
    * added cone properties

  - update to libnormaliz 3.1.1

0.9.7 (2016-03-10)
  - fix a bug in the conversion between GAP and Normaliz integer values,
    which could lead to wrong results for integers with absolute value
    roughly between 2^32 and 2^60
  - fix crash when using StructuralCopy on a cone (issue #38)
  - fix printing of certain integers on 32bit systems (issue #36)
  - give better diagnostics when loading NormalizInterface fails due
    to its kernel extension missing
