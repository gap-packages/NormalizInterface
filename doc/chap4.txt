  [33X[0;0YNormalizInterface supports GAP 4.9 or later, and Normaliz 3.5.4 or later.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  technical reasons, installing and using NormalizInterface requires that
  your  version of GAP is compiled in a special way. Specifically, GAP must be
  compiled  against  the exact same version of the GMP library as Normaliz. By
  default,  GAP  compiles its own version of GMP; however, we cannot use that,
  as it lacks C++ support, which is required by Normaliz.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThus as the very first step, please install a version of GMP in your system.
  On most Linux and BSD distributions, there should be a GMP package available
  with  your  system's  package  manager. On Mac OS X, you can install GMP via
  Fink, MacPorts or Homebrew.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNext,  make  sure  your GAP installation is compiled against the system wide
  GMP  installation. To do so, switch to the GAP root directory, and enter the
  following commands:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4Xmake clean[104X
    [4X./configure --with-gmp=PATH/TO/YOUR/GMP[104X
    [4Xmake[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YNext  you  need  to  compile a recent version of Normaliz. This requires the
  presence  of several further system software packages, which you install via
  your system's package manager. At least the following are required:[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6Ycurl OR wget for downloading the source code[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOnce  you  have  installed  these,  you  can  build  Normaliz  by  using the
  [10Xprerequisites.sh[110X  script  we provide. It takes a single, optional parameter:
  the location of the GAP root directory.[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4X./prerequisites.sh GAPDIR[104X
  [4X[32X[104X
  
  [33X[0;0YOnce  it  completed  successfully, you can then build NormalizInterface like
  this:[133X
  
  [4X[32X[104X
    [4X./configure --with-gaproot=GAPDIR[104X
