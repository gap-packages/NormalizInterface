  [33X[0;0YNormaliz  [BIRS14]  is  a  software for computations with rational cones and
  affine monoids. It pursues two main computational goals: finding the Hilbert
  basis,  a  minimal  generating  system  of the monoid of lattice points of a
  cone;  and  counting  elements  degree-wise  in  a  generating function, the
  Hilbert  series.  As  a  recent  extension,  Normaliz  can  handle unbounded
  polyhedra.  The  Hilbert  basis  computation  can be considered as solving a
  linear  diophantine  system  of  inhomogeneous  equations,  inequalities and
  congruences.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  package  encapsulates a libnormaliz cone and gives access to it in the
  GAP  enviroment.  In  this  way  GAP can be used as interactive interface to
  libnormaliz.[133X
